            <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Progamming</a></strong> is the process of performing particular computations (or more generally, accomplishing specific computing results), usually by designing and building executable computer programs.</p>
            <p>Every programmer should strive to write clean and concise code</p>

                    <td>Object Oriented Programming</td>
                    <td>Uses objects, which are instances of classes, to represent and manipulate data. It allows for the encapsulation of data and functionality, making code more modular and easier to maintain.</td>
                    <td>For example, if you were developing a game, you might create a class called "Player" that contains attributes like the player's name, score, and health status, as well as methods for movement, attacking, and interacting with objects in the game world.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Functional Programming</td>
                    <td>Focuses on the use of pure functions to solve problems. A pure function is one that always produces the same output for a given input, and has no side effects, meaning it doesn't modify any external state or data.</td>
                    <td>For example, in functional programming, you might create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. This function would only operate on the input data and produce a predictable output, without modifying any external state or data.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Procedural Programming</td>
                    <td>Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of procedures, or subroutines, to organize and execute code. Procedures are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task, and can be called from other parts of the program.</td>
                    <td>For example, in procedural programming, you might create a program that reads data from a file, processes it in a series of steps, and outputs the result to another file. The program might be structured around a main function that calls a series of smaller functions or procedures to perform each step of the processing.</td>
